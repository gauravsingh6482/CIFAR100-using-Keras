# CIFAR100-using-Keras
In this project we are classifiey images with cifar100 dataset

The CIFAR-100 dataset
This dataset is just like the CIFAR-10, except it has 100 classes containing 600 images each. There are 500 training images and 100 testing images per class. The 100 classes in the CIFAR-100 are grouped into 20 superclasses. Each image comes with a "fine" label (the class to which it belongs) and a "coarse" label (the superclass to which it belongs).
Here is the list of classes in the CIFAR-100:

In this we are use CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) to classifiey the images:-
